"NewsGuard analysts identified the AI-generated websites through keyword searches for phrases commonly produced by AI chatbots. 
The searches were conducted on the search engines Google, Bing, and DuckDuckGo, as well as a media monitoring platform. 
The analysts then verified that the sites were mostly or entirely generated by AI by examining other content for AI phrases and inputting articles into the AI text classifier GPTZero."

All API-Tools are only used to determine website age as well as deep article recognition. 
The API`s in usage are of the Wayback Machine as well as, choosable by the User, a quick-lookup of the article body text in GPTZero. 

## Please be aware that Ai-Generation, Misinformation and Scams are always evolving. Use this tool in combination with a good pinch of doubt. 
## Studies have indicated that articles by non-english natives are disproportionetly flagged as AI.

Basically, the tool judges a website by mutiple weighted criteria and if the summed up criteria points are high enough, the website gets put on the blocklist.
   - it takes the search result in DuckDuckGo for popular topics and checks each article-content-based website that is not on the whitelist. It does so for the first 5 pages each time.
   -    - the popular topics are curled regularly, as to keep it future-proof and up-to-date.
         
   - the program can run endlessly, put can be configured to only run at certain times/intervalls and through specific categories.

   - For each website, there are multiple steps the tool goes through. To see how all the steps went, you can see the log file.
