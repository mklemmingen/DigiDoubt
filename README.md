"NewsGuard analysts identified the AI-generated websites through keyword searches for phrases commonly produced by AI chatbots. 
The searches were conducted on the search engines Google, Bing, and DuckDuckGo, as well as a media monitoring platform. 
The analysts then verified that the sites were mostly or entirely generated by AI by examining other content for AI phrases and inputting articles into the AI text classifier GPTZero."
